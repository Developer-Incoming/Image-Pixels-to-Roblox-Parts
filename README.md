# Image-Pixels-to-Roblox-Parts
Take any image, put it in the python code, and after executing the code, your clipboard should now have an array of pixels copied to it.
Then you can paste the ImageData in your console or plugin's textbox, but if the imageData is large, it won't.


### And also, everything mentioned above is what I intended it to be like, but now it's worse.
Anyway I stopped developing the 1 day project beacuse of Roblox's limitatios about the characters in TextBoxes, and even your Roblox Studio's Console!.
